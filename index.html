      <p>You may be asking what programming languages to study if you want to become a web developer. Not only that, but you'll want to know which languages to prioritize first. Do you begin with? Or the most beneficial? Both? Why study JavaScript these days, when there are so many other options?</p>
      <p>You’ve no doubt heard that it&#8217;s an important web technology, but perhaps you’re not sure if JavaScript is all that relevant these days. With so many frameworks out there providing ready-to-use code, is it really necessary to <a href=https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/>learn JavaScript from scratch</a>?</p>
      <p>In this guide, we’ll explore what JavaScript does and whether or not it’s still useful. We’ll then look at some of the main reasons for learning the language, and consider why it’s necessary to learn plain JavaScript first, before libraries and frameworks.</p>

      </ol>
      <p>So: Should you learn JavaScript? Let’s find out.</p>
      <h2>1. What is JavaScript and what does it do?</h2>
  <p> It's critical to know exactly what something is and what it does before you begin learning it. This is very helpful when learning a new programming language.</p> JavaScript is a programming language that is used to create interactive websites. If you consider the core components of a website, you have HTML, which explains and specifies the website's basic content and structure, and CSS, which informs the browser how to display this HTML information, defining things like color and font. Ororor </p> You can make a website that looks nice but doesn't do much with just HTML and CSS. JavaScript adds functionality to the webpage, bringing it to life. It&#8217;s in charge of user-interactive features like drop-down menus, modal windows, and contact forms, among others. It's also used to make animations, video players, and interactive maps, among other things. Ororor </p> JavaScript is now a general-purpose programming language that can be used across the entire software stack. The most common use of JavaScript is on the client side (also known as the frontend), but since the introduction of Node.js, many people are also using it on the server side (also known as the backend). Ororor </p> JavaScript code is read, interpreted, and executed in the user's web browser when it is used on the client side. It is run on a remote computer when used on the server side. In our guide, we go over the differences between frontend and backend programming. Ororor </p> JavaScript isn't just for making webpages. It may also be used to create browser-based games and mobile apps for many operating systems with the help of particular frameworks. With the addition of new libraries and frameworks, the language may now be used to create backend programs such as web apps and server apps. Ororor </p> If you want to learn more, we've covered other examples of what JavaScript is used for, as well as code, in more detail elsewhere. But, now that we've seen some of the many applications of this twenty-five-year-old language, why should we learn it in 2021? </p>
  <h2>2. Is it still worth learning JavaScript in 2021?</h2>
      <p>The world of web development is constantly moving. With so many new tools popping up all the time, it can be extremely difficult to know where you should focus your efforts. As an aspiring developer, you’ll want to make sure that what you’re learning is still relevant in today’s industry.</p>
      <p>If you’re having doubts about this language, don&#8217;t. It’s important to note that since its creation in 1995 JavaScript is pretty much everywhere on the web—and that’s not likely to change any time soon. According to the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021?_ga=2.101268358.687021007.1628675795-1764609170.1622104162#most-popular-technologies-language" target=_blank rel=noopener data-schema-attribute>2021 StackOverflow developer survey</a>, it&#8217;s the most commonly used programming language for the ninth year in a row.</p>
      <p>It is currently used by 94.5% of all websites and, despite originally being designed as a client-side language, JavaScript has now made its way to the server-side of websites (thanks to Node.js), mobile devices (thanks to React Native and Ionic) and desktop (courtesy of Electron).</p>
      <p>If you want to kick things off now and get a taste, in this video our resident web developer Abhishek gives you an introduction to JavaScript.</p>

      </div>
      <p>As long as people are interacting with the web, you can assume that JS is highly relevant—there’s no doubt that this is a language worth knowing! With that in mind, let’s look at some of the key benefits of becoming a JavaScript expert.</p>
      <h2>3. Why learn JavaScript?</h2>
      <p>The most obvious reason for learning JavaScript is if you have hopes of becoming a web developer. Even if you haven’t got your heart set on a tech career, being proficient in this language will enable you to build websites from scratch—a pretty useful skill to have in today’s job market!</p>
      <p>If you do want to become a web developer, here are some of the main reasons why you should learn JavaScript:</p>
      <h3>JavaScript experts are versatile</h3>
      <p>JavaScript is an extremely versatile language. Once you’ve mastered it, the possibilities are endless: you can code on the client-side (frontend) using Angular and on the server-side (backend) using Node.js. You can also develop web, mobile, and desktop apps using React, React Native, and Electron, and you can even get involved in machine learning.</p>
      <p>If you want to become a frontend developer, JavaScript is a prerequisite. However, that’s not the only career path open to you as a JS expert. Mastering this key programming language could see you go on to work in full-stack development, games development, information security software engineering, machine learning, and artificial intelligence—to name just a few!</p>
      <p>Ultimately, if you want any kind of development or engineering career, proficiency in JavaScript is a must.</p>
      <h3>JavaScript experts are in-demand (and well-paid)</h3>
      <p>JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world, so it’s no wonder that it&#8217;s one of the most sought-after skills in the web development industry today.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href=https://devskiller.com/it-skills-report-2020/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Devskiller IT Skills and Hiring Report 2020</a>, 72% of companies are looking to hire JavaScript experts. Enter the <a href="https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Javascript&amp;_ga=2.41367786.915496204.1564579004-533676755.1564579004" rel=noopener>search term “JavaScript” on job site Indeed</a> and you’ll find over 40,000 jobs requiring this skill (in the US). Run the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?geoId=103644278&amp;keywords=Javascript&amp;location=United%20States" rel=noopener>same search on LinkedIn</a> and the results are in excess of 125,000.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the global demand for the language seems to outweigh the expertise available on the market. According to <a href=https://research.hackerrank.com/student-developer/2018#skills rel=noopener>this HackerRank report</a>, 48% of employers worldwide need developers with JavaScript skills, while only 42% of student developers claim to be proficient in it. And, in their <a href=https://research.hackerrank.com/developer-skills/2020#skills target=_blank rel=noopener>most recent report for 2020</a>, HackerRank once again reports that JavaScript is the most popular language that hiring mangers look for in a web developer candidate.</p>
      <p>Not only are JavaScript experts in demand—they are also well-paid. In the United States, JavaScript developers earn an average yearly salary of <a href=https://www.indeed.com/salaries/Javascript-Developer-Salaries rel=noopener>$108,871 per year</a>. We’ve covered this topic in more detail in our <a href=https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/javascript-developer-salary-guide/>JavaScript salary guide</a>, but as you can see, learning this language can really boost your earning potential as a developer.</p>
      <h3>JavaScript is beginner-friendly</h3>
      <p>Compared to many other programming languages, JavaScript offers one of the more beginner-friendly entry points into the world of coding. The great thing about it is that <strong>it comes installed on every modern web browser</strong>—there’s no need to set up any kind of development environment, which means you can start coding with JavaScript right away!</p>
      <p>Another advantage of learning JavaScript as your first programming language is that you get instant feedback; with a minimal amount of code, you’ll immediately see visible results. There’s also a huge JS community on sites like <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript rel=noopener>Stack Overflow</a>, so you’ll find plenty of support as you learn.</p>
      <p>Not only is it beginner-friendly; it will also set you up with some extremely valuable transferable skills. JavaScript supports object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles of programming—skills which can be transferred to any new language you might learn later on, such as Python, Java, or C++. JavaScript provides a crucial introduction to key principles and practices that you’ll take with you throughout your career as a developer.</p>
      <h2>4. Why learn vanilla JavaScript first?</h2>
      <p>When deciding whether or not to learn this language, what you’re really asking is whether or not you should learn “vanilla” JavaScript. Vanilla JavaScript just means the basic language without any libraries or frameworks. Let’s explore what this means in more detail now.</p>
      <h3>What is meant by vanilla JavaScript, libraries, and frameworks?</h3>
      <p>If you research the term “vanilla JavaScript”, you might run into some confusion; however, all you need to know is that vanilla JavaScript is used to refer to the native, standards-based, non-extended version. There is no difference between vanilla JavaScript and JavaScript—it’s just there to emphasize the usage of plain JavaScript without the use of libraries and frameworks.</p>
      <h4>So what are libraries and frameworks?</h4>
      <p>JavaScript libraries and frameworks both contain sets of prewritten, ready-to-use code—but they’re not the same thing. You can think of a framework as your blueprint for building a website: it gives you a structure to work from, and contains ready-made components and tools that help you to build certain elements much quicker than if you were to code them from scratch. Some popular JavaScript frameworks include Angular, React, Vue, and Node.js.</p>
      <p>Frameworks also contain libraries. Libraries are smaller than frameworks, and tend to be used for more specific cases. A JavaScript library contains sets of code which can be called upon to implement certain functions and features. Let’s imagine you want to code a particular element into your website. You could write, say, ten lines of JavaScript from scratch—or you could take the condensed, ready-made version from your chosen library. Some examples of JavaScript libraries include <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>Lodash</strong>, and <strong>Underscore</strong>.</p>
      <p>The easiest way to understand how frameworks and libraries work together is to imagine you are building a house. The framework provides the foundation and the structure, while the library enables you to add in ready-made components (like furniture) rather than building your own from scratch.</p>
      <p>You can learn more about the relationship between languages and libraries in this post explaining <a href=https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/javascript-vs-jquery-whats-the-difference/>the main differences between JavaScript and jQuery</a>. For now, let’s go back to our original question: How important is it to learn vanilla JavaScript?</p>
      <h3 >Should you learn vanilla JavaScript first?</h3>
      <p>When it comes to learning the language, it can be tempting to skip ahead to those time-saving frameworks and libraries we just talked about—and many developers do. However, there are many compelling arguments for learning plain JavaScript first.</p>
      <p>While JavaScript frameworks may help you get the job done quicker, there’s only so far you can go if you don’t understand the core concepts behind these frameworks. <a href=https://www.nagekar.com/2015/12/Love-For-Javascript.html target=_blank rel=noopener data-schema-attribute>Frontend developer Abhishek Nagekar</a> describes how not learning vanilla JavaScript came back to bite him when he started learning the JavaScript frameworks Node and Express:</p>
      <blockquote>
         <p>“As I went to write more and more code in Node and Express, I began to get stuck at even the tiniest problems. Suddenly, I was surrounded with words like callbacks, closures, event loop and prototype. It felt like I got a reintroduction to JavaScript, but this time, it was not a toddler playing in its cradle, it was something of a mysterious monster, challenging me on every other step for not having taken it seriously.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If you want to become a developer who can innovate, not just execute, you need to understand the underlying principles of the web—not just the shortcuts. This means learning vanilla JavaScript before you move on to frameworks. In fact, understanding plain JavaScript will help you later on when it comes to deciding whether to use a framework for a certain project, and if so, which framework to use.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, if you want to <a href=https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/how-to-get-your-first-web-developer-job-the-ultimate-guide-for-junior-developers/ target=_blank rel=noopener>work as a web developer</a>, it’s inevitable that you’ll encounter this web development language at almost every turn. Learning plain JavaScript first will make you a versatile engineer who can work on both the frontend and the backend, and it’ll equip you to solve complex problems independently—a key skill in the industry.</p>
      <h2 >5. What is the best way to start learning JavaScript?</h2>
      <p>So: if you want to become any kind of web developer, you absolutely need to learn this language—and you should start with plain old vanilla JavaScript first. If you&#8217;re to work out how long to give to get up to speed on the language, senior developer Marven shows you <a href=https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-javascript/>how long it should take to pick up JavaScript</a>.</p>
      <p>The best way to start learning JavaScript is to get hands-on. Once you’ve read up on what the language is and how it works, give it a go in your browser. If you’re using Google Chrome, just click “View” then select “Developer” from the drop-down menu. From there, select “JavaScript Console” and you’re good to go!</p>
      <p>As with most things, there are plenty of good resources on the web for teaching yourself JavaScript. However, if you want a more structured approach, consider a <a href=https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/>mentored web development course</a>. Whichever route you take, make sure you spend enough time learning all the basics. Once you know JavaScript inside out, you’re well-equipped to tackle the more complex languages of the web, as well as to show the benefits to the next person who asks themselves why learn JavaScript when there are other coding options out there.</p>
